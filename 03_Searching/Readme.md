# Searching

   Mainly 2 types
1. Linear Search

2. Binary Search  (Decrease and conquer Approach)
   Golden Rule : "OPTIMISATION OVER SEARCH"
   Its mostly with sorted/ similar type of array
                OR
   "You 've to maximise/minimise but limiting to some constraints
   eg. Agressive Cows, Book Allocation

   For basic questions its used for
   1. Looking for a target value
   2. Last/1st element that satisfies a certain condition 
      eg. A no which is --just-- greater than 1
   3. Real value finding
      eg. sqrt(x) with some precision
