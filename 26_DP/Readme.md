# DP

(This folder contains all BASIC DP problems from which u can countinue)

"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it"
"Always compare a new question with std question"
Since, The logic may be similar to it.

Idea
We handle smaller problems and use their learnings to solve a bigger problem

Properties of DP
1. Optimal Substructure
   If we can write a recurrence relation , then its...
2. Overlapping subproblem
   If our subproblems repeat, then its...


2 ways to handle Overlapping Subproblem
1. Memoization (Top-Down)
   A lookup table is maintained and checked before computation of a state.
   Recursion is involved.

2. Tabulation (Bottom-up)
   Solution is build from base.
   Its a iterative process

Key Problems
1. Minimisation and maximisation where we want recursive solution
   (Sometimes Binary Search also like Aggressive cows)

2. Find the no of ways

3. When recurrence relation. (Sometime with Matrix exponentiation)
